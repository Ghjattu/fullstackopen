# Redux anecdotes

In these exercises, we made a new version of the anecdote voting application from part 1 by using Redux library.

## Start

```shell
# install dependencies
npm install

# start the json server
npm run server

# start the app
npm start
```

Then you can access the app on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/), and see the data
on [http://localhost:3001/anecdotes](http://localhost:3001/anecdotes).
