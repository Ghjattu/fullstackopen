# Blog list frontend

In these exercises, we continue our work on the Blog list application that we worked on in parts four and five of the
course material.

**I used the blog list from Part 4 as the backend**, and made some changes to the backend to make it work better with the
blog list frontend from Part 7, for example, added a registration function.

## Start
After successfully configuring and starting the backend...
```shell
# install dependencies
npm install

# start the app
npm start
```

Then you can access the app on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

When you launch the app for the first time, you need to register some accounts and then use those accounts to log in.
