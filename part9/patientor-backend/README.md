# Patientor Backend

For this set of exercises we will be developing a backend for an existing project called **Patientor**, which is a
simple medical record application for doctors who handle diagnoses and basic health information of their patients.

The [frontend](https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/patientor) has already been built by outsider experts, and we task is
to create a backend to support the existing code.
